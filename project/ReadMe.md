# Wi-Fi Robot
Have you ever wanted to creepily watch people without them noticing you? JK! But not really… this repository is all about the robot that can assist you for this purpose. But you might want to use for more interesting task.

This repository will help you to create a home-made robot. The best part is that you don’t need to have any previous knowledge to do so.  This robot has the capabilities to not only move using wheels but, also, live stream using a cellphone.  The technique behind the live stream is the cooperation of a downloaded cellphone application (IP Webcam) and a local HTML page. The movement of the robot is generated by sending commands from the HTML to a Wi-Fi module which is connected to an Arduino UNO. I know it does sounds a bit complicated it but let me walk you through this.

# Repository content
* **/image** - Visual instruction guides to setting up the necessary circuits, as well as miscellaneous references and images.
* **/src** - You'll need to upload the code from here to the Arduino!.
* **ReadMe.md** - You're here.

# Requirements and Materials

## Dependencies
There is one library that must be installed in your computer before adding the code to your arduino

* 

## Materials

# Build instructions

The Arduino here works as a minicomputer which interfaces with the ESP8266 for Wi-Fi communication. The Arduino controls the two DC motors, using an Adafruit-motor-shield, which is able to control up to four motors. The motors rotate independently of one another.

I used an eight slot battery supply for powering the robot. This can be actually upgraded by using a power bank which would be more cost efficient, easier to charge, and safer for the Arduino.

Connect all the components according to the schematic. Use jumper wires to connect The ESP8266, the two motors all to the Adafruit-motor-shield. 

# Installations and Usage

With the hardware properly connected, all you’ll need to do is to upload the code to your Arduino using a USB cord. But before this you will need to change the following line of code:

**sendData("AT+CWJAP=\"XXXXX\",\"YYYYY\"\r\n", 2000, DEBUG**

Change the XXXX for the SSID of your Wi-Fi network and YYYY with the password for it. Save and upload the code.
The code can be found in this repository under /src.

Next, with the Arduino still connected to the USB cord open the serial monitor from the Arduino IDE. Use the Serial Monitor to check if the connection was successful, and to obtain which IP was assigned to your ESP-8266 by your router. Open the html page with Firefox (important) and add this IP address in the input field. Click on test and wait, if connection was successful the wheels will start spinning, press any of the arrow keys to stop it.

To live stream, you must download the IP Webcam application into your cellphone. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam

Launch IP Webcam application in the cellphone, scroll down the menu and press launch server. Type the IP given at bottom of the screen on into the HTML and click on load. It should take a couple of seconds to load, after the video will be shown below the input field.

Everything should be ready at this point. If you have not disconnect the Arduino from your computer now is more than safe to do so. To operate the robot, use the arrow keys from the keyboard.

### ENJOY!!!
